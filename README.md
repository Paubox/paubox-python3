### Python 3 Version of Paubox plugin #
EXPERIMENTAL. Currently Unsupported and not yet passing build.

Note: Must change a couple things with the README.
1. Change the order of the parameters in the sample code
2. Python3 no longer supports the `file` method and must use `open` for working with the config file
3. Add a change log
